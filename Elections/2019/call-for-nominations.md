All nominations must provide:

All nominations may optionally provide:

Following the close of nominations, there will be a one week confirmation period
to determine the eligibility of candidates. If there are more eligible candidates
than positions vacant (8), I will announce a voting period of two weeks, commencing
Monday 23 September 2019.

I am managing this election process in the role of Returning Officer and

working in these roles, Sam and I are both ineligible to stand for election.
Any concerns or enquiries about this election process can be sent to Sam or me.
